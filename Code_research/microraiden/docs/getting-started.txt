A simple pay-per-view demo
==============================================

0. Installing the requirements
------------------------------

- Browser
You'll need Chrome browser with MetaMask extension to be able to sign the payments.
Get MetaMask from here: https://metamask.github.io/

Create or import an account and ask someone to send you some tokens and bit of 
ether too.

- Python 

It is preferrable to have a virtual environment set up for running the proxy.

`virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 raiden-micropayments`

This will create a directory that contains a local installation of Python 3.
To activate the environment, do `cd raiden-micropayments && . bin/activate`.

Now change to the directory that contains raiden micropayment code and install
python dependencies.

`pip install -r raiden_mps/requirements.txt`


1. Starting the proxy
---------------------
You are ready to start the proxy! Run

`python -m raiden_mps.proxy`


2. WebUI client
----------------
If there are no errors, open Chrome and navigate to `localhost:5000/doggo.txt`.
Hm, a paywall. Someone expects you to pay for an image of a cute pooch. But the 
price is fair - we have micropayments after all.

Start by creating a channel. Choose how much you want to deposit and click `start`.
A MetaMask window will pop up, asking you to send a transaction. Do that, and after
the transaction is confirmed, sign & send another transaction. Disregard the warning 
displayed in the window - it is there only to scare the weak.

If everything went well, you will now see a magnificient doggo. Unfortunately, in this age
of greed, people expect you to pay-per-view. If you reload the page, a paywall
appears again, asking you to sign another transaction. If there are enough tokens
remaining in the channel, and if you want to entertain yourself by looking at funny
animal, press the `sign` button and repeat the procedure by signing the message.
(every Sign creates a new balance proof and every time the balance must increase, otherwise
receiver will reject this payment)

When your resources are depleted, you have an option of topping up the channel with more
tokens, or closing and settling the channel.

After pressing `close` and confirming the transaction, channel will be switched to `closed`
state. (The receiver can now challenge the balance proof - don't try to cheat by closing
the channel with an earlier signature!)

Settling is possible only after the challenge period is over. Settling will effectively
terminate the channel and transfers spent funds to the receiver on-chain, and returns
the rest to the sender.
