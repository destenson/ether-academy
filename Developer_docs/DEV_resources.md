**Updates**

Ethereum Wallet and Mist are currently released at version 0.9.0: https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases
	

**Clients**

"Ethereum doesn’t really have the concept of a “reference client”. If you take the literal meaning of “client that people refer to to improve their understanding of protocol rules”, then in many cases that’s actually pyethereum because python is easier to read. The C++ client is the client that generates the test suites. So counting commits to Geth imo understates the decentralization of the ecosystem." -Vitalik Buterin in the following blog post https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/regarding-bitcoin-and-ethereum-dev-and-client-decentralization-i-think-those-four-graphs-miss-two-5a21c39ba298


**User interfaces** 

" User interfaces in Ethereum are a broad category, including ... 
The Mist browser, as well as applications written in HTML/Javascript that can be used either inside of Mist or through a user's regular browser. Block explorers such as etherchain,
 etherscan and ether.camp. Note that unlike similar tools for many other blockchains, which focus purely on currency balances and transactions, Ethereum block explorers tend to be 
highly advanced and general, offering views into contract state, functions, internal transactions, etc"	- from Go-Ethereum(Geth) Wiki
